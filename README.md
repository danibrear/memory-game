# Memory Game

This was a coding exercise done for time. The original implementation was not styled well so I wanted to write it again on my own so I could improve the styling and add some animations.
It is a simple memory game where you have to remember which cells you have clicked on. The game has three states: START, PLAYING, and ENDED. You can adjust the difficulty of the game by changing the number of cells in the grid.
